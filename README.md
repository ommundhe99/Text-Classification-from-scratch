# Text Classification from Scratch
## Project Overview
This project demonstrates text sentiment classification starting from raw text files, specifically using the IMDB movie review dataset. The implementation leverages the TextVectorization layer for word splitting and indexing, and uses a simple 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification. The project is optimized for GPU acceleration.
